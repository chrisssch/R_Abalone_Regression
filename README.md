# Regularized Regression with the Abalone Dataset in R

This notebook is for practicing machine learning with different parametric regression and regularization methods - linear and polynomial regression, ridge regression, lasso, and stepwise model selection - with the caret and glmnet packages as well as preprocessing data with PCA. 

The data used is the Abalone data set from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](
http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Abalone). The goal is to predict the age of Abalone snails based on a number of biological attributes.
